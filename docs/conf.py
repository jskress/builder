# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# The version info for the project you're documenting, acts as replacement for
# |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the
# built documents.
#
# The short X.Y version.

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# a list of builtin themes.
